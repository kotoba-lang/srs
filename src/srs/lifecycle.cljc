(ns srs.lifecycle
  "The domain lifecycle state machine — allocation, renewal, transfer, and the
  Registry Grace Periods of RFC 3915 — as a pure function of state, command,
  policy and time.

  This is the part of a registry that is *not* a protocol. EPP (RFC 5730-5734)
  is how a command arrives and RDAP (RFC 9083) is how the result is published,
  but neither says what a domain does between them: when it auto-renews, how
  long redemption lasts, whether a delete on day 4 is a refund and a delete on
  day 6 is not. Registries encode that in stored procedures and cron jobs, and
  it becomes untestable — the interesting transitions are 30 to 45 days apart,
  so nobody runs them.

  Three commitments make it testable instead:

  **No clock.** Every function takes `now` in epoch milliseconds. A 10-year
  lifecycle is an ordinary `reduce` over a vector of instants, not a fixture
  that has to sleep.

  **No implicit transitions.** Time-driven changes — auto-renew at expiry,
  redemption ending, a transfer auto-approving on day 5 — happen in `advance`
  and nowhere else. A command never silently sweeps the calendar on its way
  past. If a domain has been untouched for two years, `advance` applies every
  due transition in order and reports each one; it does not jump to the end
  state and lose the events in between, because those events are what billing
  and the zone publisher consume.

  **Failure is a value.** Every transform returns `{:ok? false :error {…}}`
  with an EPP result code (RFC 5730 §3), never an exception. `org-ietf-epp`
  maps the code straight onto the wire, so the reason a registrar's command
  was refused is the reason they are told.

  ## The phases

      available ──create──▶ active ──delete──▶ redemption ──▶ pendingDelete ──▶ purged
                              ▲                    │                              │
                              └────restore─────────┘                              ▼
                                                                              available

  `active` is the only phase with a public presence; everything after `delete`
  is a countdown. `purged` is terminal and means the name is allocatable again
  — kept as an explicit phase rather than deleting the record, because the
  registry still owes RDAP an answer about a name that existed yesterday, and
  because a name that went through redemption is a different thing from a name
  that never existed.

  Grace periods overlay `active` rather than replacing it (RFC 3915 §3.1): a
  domain in `addPeriod` is an ordinary active domain that happens to be
  refundable. Modeling them as phases — as the naive reading of the RFC's
  status list invites — makes them mutually exclusive, and they are not: a
  domain can sit in `renewPeriod` and `transferPeriod` at once."

  pedantry until it happens: a registrar retrying a renew it never saw
  acknowledged, against a registry that already applied it, renews twice and
  bills the registrant twice. Matching the caller's view of the expiry against
  the registry's turns that retry into a no-op error instead of a second year.
  Passing `nil` skips the check, which is a choice a caller has to make
  explicitly.

  The comparison is at **day** granularity, because `curExpDate` is an
  `xs:date` on the wire (RFC 5731 §3.2.3) and carries no time of day. Comparing
  epoch milliseconds would reject every well-formed renew whose registry expiry
  happens to fall at 12:00 rather than midnight — the check would then be
