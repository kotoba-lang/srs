  "Proleptic Gregorian civil-date arithmetic on epoch milliseconds, in pure
  portable integer math.

  Why hand-rolled rather than `java.time`: a registration term is a *calendar*
  term. A domain created 2024-02-29 for one year expires 2025-02-28, not
  2025-02-28T‌…-plus-drift, and a domain created 2024-01-31 for one month is
  not 2024-03-02. Approximating a year as 365 days puts the expiry date on the
  wrong day for every domain whose term spans a leap day — which after ten
  years is most of them. So the arithmetic has to be real, and it has to run
  everywhere this library runs (`java.time` is JVM-only; `js/Date` is CLJS-only
  and does local-timezone arithmetic unless you are careful), so it is written
  once here in integer math that has no host at all.

  The algorithm is Howard Hinnant's `days_from_civil` / `civil_from_days`
  (http://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html), which is exact for the
  proleptic Gregorian calendar over the whole range we care about. It shifts
  the year to start in March so the leap day lands at the end of the cycle and
  falls out of the integer division.

  Everything here is UTC. Registry dates are UTC by definition (RFC 5731 uses
  `dateTime` values and every registry publishes in Z), and introducing a local
  zone would make the same domain expire on different days for different
  operators."
