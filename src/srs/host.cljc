(ns srs.host
  "Host objects (RFC 5732) — nameservers as first-class registry objects rather
  than strings on a domain.

  `srs.core` stored nameservers as plain names, which works right up to the
  point where the registry has to answer two questions it cannot:

  - **Is this nameserver still in use?** A host referenced by any domain cannot
    be deleted, and a registry that keeps only strings has no way to know. RFC
    5732 §3.2.2 calls this an association, and deleting an associated host
    breaks every domain that delegates to it.
  - **Where does the glue live?** A nameserver *inside* the zone it serves —
    `ns1.example.com` serving `example.com` — is unreachable without an address
    record in the parent, because resolving it requires already knowing it.
    That is the whole reason glue exists, and whether a host needs it is a
    property of the host, not of any one domain that points at it.

  ## In-zone versus out-of-zone is the load-bearing distinction

  `ns1.example.com` for `example.com` is **in-zone** and MUST carry addresses.
  `ns1.example.net` for `example.com` is **out-of-zone** and MUST NOT — the
  registry is not authoritative for `example.net` and any address it published
  would be a second, stale copy of someone else's data. RFC 5732 §1.1 states
  both directions, and implementations routinely get the second one wrong:
  storing an address for an out-of-zone host looks helpful and quietly makes
  the registry an unreliable authority for a name it does not own.

  Everything here is pure: hosts go in a map, `now` is an argument, and no
  storage or clock is imported."
