(ns srs.core
  "The registry as a value: a map of name → domain, and one `execute` that
  takes a command and returns the next registry plus the events it produced.

  `srs.lifecycle` knows what happens to *a* domain. This namespace is the
  Shared Registry System proper — the thing that owns the whole namespace of
  names, decides that `example.com` is one object rather than two, and gives
  EPP a single door to push commands through.

  It holds no storage and no clock. A registry value goes in, a registry value
  comes out, and persistence is the caller's problem — which is what lets the
  same code run against an in-memory map in a test, a Datomic database in
  production, and a `kgraph` assertion log in a Kotoba host, without the
  lifecycle rules knowing which.

      (-> (empty-registry \"com\")
          (execute {:command/kind :domain/create :command/name \"example.com\" …} now)
          :registry)

  ## Why events are returned rather than applied

  A create is not only a state change: it is a line on an invoice, a delegation
  to publish into the zone, and an RDAP record that changes. If `execute`
  performed those, `srs` would have to know about billing, DNS and HTTP, and
  every one of them would be untestable without the others. Returning them as
  data keeps the direction of dependency pointing one way — `domain-billing`
  and the zone publisher read `srs` events; `srs` reads nothing."
