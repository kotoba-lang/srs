(ns srs.status
  "EPP object status values (RFC 5731 §2.3) and RGP grace-period statuses
  (RFC 3915 §3.1), as data — plus the one thing the RFCs state in prose and
  every registry then re-implements by hand: **which operations each status
  actually prohibits**.

  Status is not decoration. `clientTransferProhibited` is the single flag
  standing between a domain and a hostile transfer, and `serverHold` is the
  difference between a name resolving and not. A registry that stores these as
  opaque strings has to spell the policy out again at every call site, and the
  call sites drift. Here the prohibition is attached to the status itself, so
  `blocked-ops` is the only place that knowledge lives.

  Two axes the RFC keeps deliberately separate, and so do we:

  - **who set it** — `client*` statuses are set by the sponsoring registrar and
    may be cleared by it; `server*` statuses are set by the registry and the
    registrar cannot clear them. Same prohibition, different authority. A
    registry that collapses the two lets a registrar clear a registry lock.
  - **prohibition vs. pending** — `pendingTransfer` is a state, not a policy;
    it blocks other transforms because the object is mid-operation, not because
    anyone forbade anything.

  `ok` is not a status like the others: RFC 5731 §2.3 defines it as the value
  an object carries when it has *no* other status. It is derived, never stored
  — see `normalize`."
